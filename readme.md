[PlaylistFM](https://github.com/sabarasaba/PlaylistFM)
=================

Its a very simple app, it allows you to create a playlist of an artist based in the top charts of lastfm from that artist. It provides a nice and clean metro UI which is based in the awesome work of [this fellas](http://nuget.org/packages/MahApps.Metro). It also uses the [taglib-sharp library](http://download.banshee.fm/taglib-sharp/) to read the the ID3/2 tag from the media files.
